## Overview

This is the repository associated with the data science knowledge test. This is not a package generation attempt, but collects all the information needed to reproduce the test such as package, functions and code. 

The [dataset](https://data.birmingham.gov.uk/dataset/purchase-card-transactions) to develop the test is a collection of purchase card transactions for the Birmingham City Council.

├── cleaning_data.R -> 01
├── merge_data.R -> 02
├── descriptive_analysis.R -> 03
```
The cleaning_data.R script uses the [rvest](https://github.com/tidyverse/rvest)  package for web scraping development. To standardize the process it is necessary to run both cleaning_data.R and merge_data.R. In the repository you will find the file that was used in rmarkdown, called document.Rmd. For the development of the model, we worked with the [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org) environment.

It is recommended to use a version of [R](https://cran.dcc.uchile.cl) higher than 4.0 and to install the latest version for each package used. It is possible to use [pacman](https://github.com/trinker/pacman) for ease of use.
